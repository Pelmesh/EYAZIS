Since ancient times, people have had ways of dealing with data and numbers. Early
people tied knots in rope and carved marks on clay tablets to keep track of livestock
and trade. Some people consider the 5000-year-old ABACUS - a frame with beads
strung on wires - to be the first true computing aid.
